# Orago

Orago is an experimental IRCd. Probably built around microservices or something, probably with the core and the leafs separated or something, etc. Less of [this](https://github.com/DanielOaks/dcmi/) and more of a modern thing built with a more modern architectural lean to it.

Very experimental. Very not-production-ready. Do not perceive this repo, etc.
